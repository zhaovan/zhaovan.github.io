							Hi there, I'm Ivan!
							I'm currently a Freshman at Brown studying Applied Math and Computer Science.
				 			This semester, I'm working as a Business Development Intern at
							<a href = "https://www.nlyst.com/" target = _blank>Nlyst</a>,
				 			a Providence-based startup trying to revolutionize the entry-level hiring scene for companies by
				 			creating an analyst program for outgoing juniors and seniors. This past summer
				 			I also worked on a small project called Scope that connected high school seniors
				 			with a college student at their respective college and major of interest.
				 			<br>
				 			<br>
				 			My academic interests range from optimizing space, both physical and online,
				 			by utilizing design properties and thinking to applications of game theory in
				 			both actual economic markets and board games. I'm generally interested all facets of life and
							will talk and listen to anything, ranging from the architecture of
				 			the
				 			<a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=visartspub" target = _blank>
							Chiesa di San Carlino alle Quattro Fontane</a> to the amazing symbolism in
				 			the game <a href="https://www.celestegame.com" target = _blank>Celeste</a>, an Indie game
							that won best Indie Game and best Game for Impact in 2018 (I highly recommend checking it out).Â 
				 			<br>
				 			<br>
				 			Other things of interest: the intersection of technology, humans, and optimization of operations,
							art history, entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, interior design and how it affects our living space,
							LGBTQ+ support in the startup and venture capital scene around the world,
							traveling, board games, baking and eating Chinese food, rock climbing,
				 			and music/musicals.

							<h2>Current Projects</h2>
							At my job, I'm currently working on revamping the website. You can find that linked above.
							I'm also working on sourcing companies in the NYC area to find places that would be interested
							in partaking in our analyst program.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Past projects (CS Related)</h2>
							In my first intro CS seqeuence at Brown, we created a binary calculator,
							a chatbot, a Racket reader written in OCaml, and Connect4 (where a basic
							AI was created using depth first search on a binary search tree). These
							are all listed in my <a href="https://github.com/zhaovan">github</a>
							<br>
							<br>
							In the second intro CS seqeunce at Brown, we've created a basic realtor portal
							and a simplified version of Google's search algorithm (including PageRank). These
							will be uploaded on the github shortly.
