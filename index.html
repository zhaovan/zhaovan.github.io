        		<h2>Hi there, I'm Ivan!</h2>
			<p>I'm currently a Freshman at Brown studying Applied Math - Computer Science.
				 I currently work at <a href= "https://www.nlyst.com/" target=_blank> Nlyst</a>,
				 a Providence-based startup trying to redefine the hiring scene for companies by
				 creating an analyst program for outgoing juniors and seniors. This past summer
				 I also worked on a small project called Scope that connected high school seniors
				 with a college student at their respective college and major of interest.
				 <br>
				 My academic interests range from optimizing space, both physical and online,
				 by utilizing design properties and thinking to applications of game theory in
				 both actual economic markets and board games. I'm generally interested in life
				 in general and will talk and listen to anything, ranging from the architecture of
				 the Chiesa di San Carlino alle Quattro Fontane to the amazing amount symbolism in
				 the game Celeste (which I highly recommend checking out). 
				 <br>
				 Other things of interest: crosswords, art, travelling, doggos, board games,
				 baking and eating Chinese food, entrepreneurship, design, rock climbing,
				 musicals, Arduino, and LGBTQ+ support.</p>
